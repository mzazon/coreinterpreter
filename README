1.0 Introduction
================

This application implements a scanner, parser, and executor for the Toy language
"Core" as defined in the CSE3341 Project Description.

The application consists of several classes, but the general layout and program flow is described below:


|==============|     |==============|     |==============|    |==============|
| Input file   |     | Scanner      |     | Parser       |    | Executor     |
|              |---> |              |---> |              |--->|              |
|              |     |              |     |              |    |              |

2.0 Usage Guide
================

To compile the application from source, you must have the g++ GNU C++ compiler
installed on your system, with all standard libraries installed.

At the command line run the following command:

"make"

This will invoke the g++ compiler and link all necessary source files into a
binary executable file called "main".

To run the program, you must specify one input parameter on the command line,
otherwise an error message will be displayed.  The argument is the path to and
filename of the input Core language file to be executed.
